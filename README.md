# Predicting-Detectability-of-Transiting-Exoplanets
This is a user-friendly astronomy tool geared towards amateurs interested in studying transiting exoplanets.

To use this code, edit all of the data in the "INPUTS" section. The rest of the code is ready to run. This code uses the commonly cited "CCD Equation" to calculate signal-to-noise ratio, which is converted to minimum detectable transit depth in parts-per-thousand. Its accuracy has been tested using both amateur and research grade equipment.
